<div class="textblock"><p>The <code>drcachesim</code> trace format includes information intended for use by core simulators as well as pure cache simulators. For traces that are not filtered by an online first-level cache, each data reference is preceded by the instruction fetch entry for the instruction that issued the data request. Additionally, on x86, string loop instructions involve a single insruction fetch followed by a loop of loads and/or stores. A <code>drcachesim</code> trace includes a special "no-fetch" instruction entry per iteration so that core simulators have the instruction information to go along with each load and store, while cache simulators can ignore these "no-fetch" entries and avoid incorrectly inflating instruction fetch statistics.</p>
<p>Offline traces guarantee that a branch target instruction entry in a trace must immediately follow the branch instruction with no intervening thread switch. This allows a core simulator to identify the target of a branch by looking at the subsequent trace entry. However, this guarantee does not hold when a kernel event such as a signal is delivered immediately after a branch.</p>
<p>Traces include scheduling markers providing the timestamp and hardware thread identifier on each thread transition, allowing a simulator to more closely match the actual hardware if so desired.</p>
<p>Traces also include markers indicating disruptions in user mode control flow such as signal handler entry and exit.</p>
<p>A final feature that aids core simulators is the pair of interfaces <a class="el" href="classmodule__mapper__t.html#ad58566855786b3b63cf6a05cfb496653">module_mapper_t::get_loaded_modules()</a> and <a class="el" href="classmodule__mapper__t.html#add0cc122b72c75d519971cde9eeffd87">module_mapper_t::find_mapped_trace_address()</a>, which facilitate reading the raw bytes for each instruction in order to obtain the opcode and full operand information. </p>
