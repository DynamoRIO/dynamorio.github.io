# Reporting Bugs

DynamoRIO is a tool platform, with end-user tools built on top of it.  If
you encounter a crash in a tool provided by a third party, please locate
the issue tracker for the tool you are using and report the crash there.

To report a bug in DynamoRIO itself or in a tool that ships with the
DynamoRIO release, use [our Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues).

For general questions, use
the [users list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/DynamoRIO-Users)
rather than opening an issue in the tracker.  The users list will
reach a wider audience of people who might have an answer, and it will
reach other users who may find the information beneficial. The issue
tracker is for specific detailed bugs.
