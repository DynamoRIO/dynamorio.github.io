DynamoRIO is a tool platform, with end-user tools built on top of it.  If
you encounter a crash in a tool provided by a third party, please locate
the issue tracker for the tool you are using and report the crash there.

To report a bug in DynamoRIO itself or in a tool that ships with the
DynamoRIO release, use [our Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/issues).
