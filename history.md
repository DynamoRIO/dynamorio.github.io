# The History of DynamoRIO

DynamoRIO originated from a collaboration between MIT and Hewlett-Packard
in 2001.  HP Labs created the
[Dynamo](http://en.scientificcommons.org/42436731) system for
PA-RISC in the 1990's.  A port to IA-32 was begun in 2000 and continued in
collaboration with the Runtime Introspection and Optimization
(_RIO_) group at MIT.  The name originated from
combining _Dynamo_ with _RIO_.

## MIT Releases

Four versions were released to the public
and [hosted at MIT](http://cag.csail.mit.edu/dynamorio/):

## Determina

The DynamoRIO developers at MIT started a security company called Determina
using the DynamoRIO software.  Determina built its award-winning security
products, the Memory Firewall and Vulnerability Protection Suite, on top of
the DynamoRIO platform.

## VMware Releases

VMware acquired DynamoRIO in 2007.  Five versions were released from VMware
